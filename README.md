# gerp
Gerp is a C++-based file search tool inspired by the Unix grep command. It recursively indexes and searches files within a given directory for specific words, supporting both case-sensitive and case-insensitive queries.

Features: 
  Efficient indexing and search using a nested hash table structure:
  Insensitive → Sensitive → Occurrence Count
  Recursive directory traversal using an n-ary tree representation
  Optimized file I/O and memory-efficient data storage
  Robust string processing to handle special characters and formatting
  
Technologies & Concepts: 
  C++ (Modern C++)
  Custom data structures for performance
  Hash tables and string hashing
  File system traversal and management
  Algorithm optimization for large-scale text processing
  
This project significantly enhanced my skills in systems programming, data structures, and the design of scalable search tools.
